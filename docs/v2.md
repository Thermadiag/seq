Notes on version 2 of seq library
---------------------------------

The version 2 of seq introduced several changes on all modules, which are listed below.

The biggest change is the full removal of the `cvector` class (compressed vector-like container). Indeed, `cvector` relied on a compression algorithm that was heavily refactored and upgraded, up to the point where it did not belong to a library about containers...
Therefore, the compression algorithm and the `cvector` class were moved to a new open source project called <a href="https://github.com/Thermadiag/stenos">stenos</a>.
Removing the `cvector` class and associated compression method allowed to switch to a full header-only library.

Note that the `memory` module (deprecated in v1.3) was also removed.

[bits](docs/bits.md)
--------------------

-	Internal refactoring.
-	Updated SEQ_LIKELY/SEQ_UNLIKELY to use c++20 [[likely]]/[[unlikely]] attributes if available.
-	Added class `fast_rand`: fasd 32 bits random number generator.

[hash](docs/hash.md)
--------------------

-	Internal refactoring.
-	Moved implementation which was in `hash.cpp` to `hash_impl.hpp`


[charconv](docs/charconv.md)
----------------------------

-	Internal refactoring
-	Removed file `charconv.cpp`
-	All functions to read/write integral/floating numbers are now template, and work on any character type instead of just `char`.

[format](docs/format.md)
------------------------

-	Full refactoring of the module.
-	All functions now work with any character type including `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t` and `char8_t` (if available).

[any](docs/any.md)
------------------

-	Minor refactoring only.

[containers](docs/containers.md)
--------------------------------

-	Sequential random-access containers: 
	-	[seq::devector](docs/devector.md):
		-	Minor refactoring.
		-	Corrected a memory leak in shrink_to_fit().
		-	Updated the internal strategy when growing from front or back: the data are not anymore moved in the middle of the array in case of front/back growing.
		This allows to get rid of the last template parameter `DEVectorFlag`. devector now behaves almost exactly like the QVector class.
	-	[seq::tiered_vector](docs/tiered_vector.md): 
		-	Minor refactoring and optimizatoins.
		-	Update of the iterator class which was not detected as random access by c++20 concept random_access_iterator.
-	Sequential stable non random-access container: `seq::sequence`: minor refactoring.
-	Sorted containers: 
	-	[seq::flat_set](docs/flat_set.md), `seq::flat_map`, `seq::flat_multiset`, `seq::flat_multimap`: 
		-	Internal refactoring and optimizations
		-	Better support of transparent comparison functions
	-	[seq::radix_set](docs/radix_tree.md) and `seq::radix_map`:
		- Full refactoring to simplify the class.
		- It now supports any kind of key that has `data()` and `size()` members (all string classes, std::vector, std::array...)
		- The tree is now rebalanced when erasing keys in order to reduce its memory footprint.
-	Hash tables: 
	-	[seq::ordered_set](docs/ordered_set.md) and `seq::ordered_map`: minor refactoring
	-	[seq::radix_hash_set](docs/radix_tree.md) and `seq::radix_hash_map`: 
		-	Same huge refactoring as [seq::radix_set](docs/radix_tree.md).
		-	Better handling of transparent hash/comparison functions.
	-	[seq::concurrent_map](docs/concurrent_map.md) and `seq::concurrent_set`:
		-	Internal refactoring and optimizations.
		-	Added mechanisms to avoid busy wait on shard rehash. This increases performances on insert operations.
-	Strings:
	-	[seq::tiny_string](docs/tiny_string.md): minor changes in the `find_*` functions. Added several type traits to help detect string types and character types.
